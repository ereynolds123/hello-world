Hello World!

I am a new Developer. I am working through the Software Development Bootcamp with Burlington Code Academy. I hope to eventually use code for social justice issues and to work through the complex problems of our day. I passionately believe that we need more queer, women programmers and hope to help diversify the field. Please feel free to look through my repositories. If you are looking for examples of my web development work, please check out https://www.horsescowscemeteries.com

Also, feel free to send me any questions you may have. 

If you are a recruiter, feel free to check out my LinkedIn account https://www.linkedin.com/in/emily-reynolds-901339183/

I hope to get to know the developer community more. Let's collaborate!

Emily Reynolds
